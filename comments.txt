Patrick.Sw about 13 hours ago Hey Team got a Question: From what I understand from the docs, I can set up my 2 NVMe SSDs in my D8 Ultra in one of two ways: - Either as a cache pool that acts as a read/write buffer before files are moved to/from the main array - Or as a separate RAID volume without any caching functionality So, as far as I can tell, thereâ€™s no way to have both: use them as a buffer and as a NVMe storage for VM's etc. like you can in Unraid?
Vinay K S about 17 hours ago Hello, Iam using WD MyCloud Nas. Is there is any way to use that Nas hdd in zetlab. As Raid will be different iam curious, are you working on any sync application. Also my plan is to deactivate one drive in WD (as it uses Raid1) and use that drive in zetlab and copy files. Will this work....?
Nasir Razzaq about 18 hours ago I know its cheeky to be asking this question while we are still waiting for the first set of products to become reality but will ask anyway. Do you have a hardware roadmap as well? There are questions about 225H processor etc and seen ads for another company offering 100 TOPS system. Just thinking how long will this initial product last for before it is superseded.
Stefan M about 13 hours ago There will always be some other company with a newer hardware, thats the tech world. Today new and shiny tomorrow old, if you wait till the 225h is coming a new company will be around the corner with a 335h or whatever... If you build a product like this you build it for a reasonable price quality power etc.... in mind. And if you always change hardware to the newest you product will never be finished and see the day light. Look at Synology, their cpus are outdated but people buy it and use it for years, if you want best at the moment anytime hardware, the only solution is DIY. It all depends on you particular usecase, do you need that 100tops ?Then you have a higher price tag
Nasir Razzaq about 12 hours ago @Stefan thatâ€™s very true. I am just having second thoughts as the campaign deaws to closure. Have a synology 916+ and recently bought 920+ so going through a phase of justifying this purchase to myself (personal use only, AI on photos and videos is the main attraction).

Isaac J about 23 hours ago D6 Ultra Backer! Will there be an IOS/Android App to transfer data between the NAS and iPhone. If so, what other features can we expect to see with a phone app. Thanks

Adam Nealis 1 day ago I was reading the FAQ on Kickstarter. I noticed btrfs is the only filesystem supported. As I had never heard of btrfs I decided to find out about it. It looks like RAID 5/ 6 are not recommended for production with btrfs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs#Implemented_but_not_recommended_for_production_use Could you please comment on this and perhaps elevate the answers to FAQs? What are the recommended RAID configurations? Does using hardware RAID help with btrfs reliability with RAID 5/ 6? Which RAID cards are supported?

Marcio Camurati 3 days ago Hi, are there any additional fees for shipping to Brazil, or will those be paid before the package is sent?
ZettlabCreator 1 day ago Hi Marcio, customs fees are included, so you wonâ€™t need to pay any additional taxes upon delivery. Youâ€™ll only need to cover part of the shipping cost, which depends on the model you pledged for. You will know the exact shipping fee when you make your pledge.

ZettlabCreator 1 day ago Hi John, as for the M.2 SSDs: with one SSD, you can use it either as a high-speed read cache or as a separate storage pool. If you install a second SSD, you can enable both read and write caching.

callum mahon 4 days ago Hi Guys, I pledged and it added the HKD631 for shipping but on the post pledge page i noticed it says "Once your reward is ready to be fulfilled, you'll redeem your pledge by paying shipping and tax." and the actual pledge panel says "Customs fee included All tax included" Im assuming this is just a standard line from kickstarter and not another second shipping and tax cost.
ZettlabCreator 4 days ago Hi friend, thanks so much for your support! Yes, customs fees are included, and you will not need to pay any additional tax costs.

Chase Laux 5 days ago Does the pledge come with any bad storage like 2 8 tb iron wolf nas? Are there recommended brands or sizes since all drives should be same size?
ZettlabCreator about 22 hours ago Hi! Our pledge does not include any storage drives â€” you'll need to purchase your own HDDs or SSDs separately. We support mixing different drive sizes and brands, so you're free to use what you already have. However, please note that for certain RAID configurations, the usable capacity will be limited by the smallest drive in the array. If you're aiming for optimal performance and storage efficiency, we recommend keeping the drive sizes consistent when possible. Before mass production and shipping, we will update the compatibility list on our official website ( https://wiki.zettlab.com/) in advance, which includes drives that have been strictly tested by us.

nme61Superbacker 7 days ago I currently run a synology NAS is there ia way i could move the HDs from the synology to the zettlab with out loosing data or would i still need to format the drive and start a fresh
ZettlabCreator 6 days ago Hi, we do not support directly using hard drives from other NAS systems with Zettlab NAS, as RAID configurations from other brands are not transferable. We recommend backing up your data into new drives or the backup app for data backup.

ZettlabCreator 6 days ago Hi! Thanks for asking. Currently, we do not support Carbon Copy Cloner or ChronoSync. However, we will support macOS Time Machine for backups, and our built-in backup software will include sync features to enable data backup and synchronization across different devices.

Thomas Argante 8 days ago I'm looking for a secure and private alternative for Google Drive. Is a D4 something that could work for me? I'm a noob on this, sorry if its a stupid question.
ZettlabCreator 6 days ago Hi! Not a stupid question at all, itâ€™s actually a great one, and D4 might be just what you're looking for. Ease of use: With our shortcut feature, you can create an account and set up RAID with just a simple command. The interface is beginner-friendly â€” even testers and influencers with no prior NAS experience have highlighted how easy it is to use. Privacy & security: You can use the D4 completely offline. No third parties involved, and everything stays on your own device. It supports HTTPS authentication and certificate upload. Encrypted data transmission, firewall and antivirus will also be supported, so your data stays protected and private. So if you're looking for a secure, private alternative to Google Drive, especially as a beginner, D4 is a great fit!

David Lee WaltersSuperbacker 10 days ago Any chance if the Campaign hits $1,500,000 that you would upgrade the processor(s)?
ZettlabCreator 9 days ago Hi Mark, we support mixing different hard drive sizes. However, like with traditional RAID 5, the total usable capacity is based on the smallest drives in the array. We're currently exploring flexible RAID options similar to Synology Hybrid RAID to better support mixed-drive setups without wasting capacity. Stay tuned!
Mark Oostveen 9 days ago Perfect! Hope to see it on the roadmap! Thanks for the efforts and response!
